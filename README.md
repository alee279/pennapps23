# Yapple - learn new languages through yapping


Did you ever had a hard time learning a new language or wanted to learn what people are talking behind your back when they are speaking another language? Come to Yapple, where you can yap to new friends while having a hard time understanding each other but that is ok. The struggle is always real.

When you first create an account, you are required to fill in what languages that you are fluent in and are trying to learn. Afterwards, you will be matched with potential Yappers who are fluent in the languages that you are trying to learn and vice versa for them.

We used MongoDB as our database to store users' and chat information. With express and NodeJS, we created routes to connect our server to our client. For our beautifully laid out UI, we used ReactJS.
